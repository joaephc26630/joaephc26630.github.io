### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

  Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs of the semester! Its really funny to look back and understad fully now
  what me and my partner were really doing even though at the time we werent really sure what we were doing.
  It was pretty cool seeing the hello.cc program work and return the Hello World!

* Lab 5

  Lab 5 was another one of my favorite labs of the semester! It was one of the first times were I saw
  how math and Computer Science can really be combined. It was fun creating a program in part 1 where
  you can find the area of any rectangle through that program!
  
* Lab 8

  Lab 8 was also another one of my favorite Labs! It was another one of my favorites because it was one of
  the first labs where we used loops! It was really fun using our new knowlegde of loops to be able to
  create a cool pattern!
